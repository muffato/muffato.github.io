# Experience

## Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom

### Informatics Infrastructure Team Lead

_Since Feb 2021_

<u>Keywords</u>: Strategic thinking, Technical leadership, Systems design,
Mentorship, People management, Software development management, Operations
management, Recruitment, Documentation, User training and support.<br/>
<u>Team size</u>: 5-7 people.

I lead the Informatics Infrastructure team for the Tree of Life programme. The team:

- implements large-scale genome analysis pipelines for faculty teams;
- maintains the production environment (application deployment and pipeline orchestration);
- manages and curates metadata across our production systems.

I arranged the team's growth in two phases:

1. Establish the core systems infrastructure and framework, hiring DevOps, software development, and bioinformatics staff.
2. Expand capabilities for data curation, management, and analysis.

My ambition is to provide the most efficient platform for assembling and
[analysing genomes at an unprecedented scale](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8063873). The Tree of Life projects will generate tens of thousands of high-quality genomes in the coming years — more than have ever been sequenced. This is a challenging and exciting endeavour that will shape the future of biology.

I'm especially proud to have introduced rigorous ![icon](/assets/img/icon/nfcore.png) nf-core best practices (even [extending the tooling](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13913055)) and ![icon](/assets/img/topics/nextflow.png) Nextflow pipeline standards into the programme ([talk](https://youtu.be/w4RGam3T8iQ?si=VClvr11swxxMbylO)).
I also helped shift our teams' focus toward compute efficiency and green computing ([talk](https://youtu.be/e1UcnkI8-Fk?si=47r-wRJ3_SXHVKNM)).

We act as the interface between the Tree of Life teams (assembly production and faculty research) and Sanger’s IT teams, collaborating with informatics groups across other programmes. Our work spans assembly methods, genomics, comparative genomics, cloud computing, and large-scale analyses, with a strong emphasis on metadata tracking, quality control, and event recording. The team supports the "Genome Engine" from beginning to end.

In parallel, I serve as Head of Informatics for Tree of Life. In this role I represent and support Tree of Life informatics within the Institute by ensuring sufficient IT capacity and policy compliance, and by drafting strategy and policy documents for the department, the Institute, and partner projects such as ERGA ([links](https://zenodo.org/search?q=metadata.creators.person_or_org.identifiers.identifier%3A%220000-0002-7860-3560%22&f=resource_type%3Apublication)).

## European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Hinxton, United Kingdom

I worked in the Comparative Genomics team of the Ensembl genome browser. The team performed comparative analyses, developed new methods and algorithms (including API and database schema extensions), and applied them to new datasets. Scalability was a primary concern as we processed hundreds of genomes under tight timelines.

I also contributed to the development of the [eHive workflow manager](https://ensembl-hive.readthedocs.io), a system for creating and running workflows on distributed compute resources. eHive scheduled and executed the equivalent of over 1,000 CPU years of compute each year for Ensembl.

### Principal Developer

_Oct 2019 to Jan 2021_

<u>Keywords</u>: Development management. Technical leadership. Recruitment. Mentorship.
API development. Database design and optimisation. Workflow design and development.
User support (data, API, workflows).<br/>
<u>Team size</u>: 3 people.

In this role I transferred knowledge accumulated over eight years to the new Project Leader and developers, while supporting and overseeing software development ([details](https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1118390.1)).

We initiated a major revamp of compute workflows and data storage to handle the scale of projects such as the Darwin Tree of Life, aiming to provide comparative analyses for tens of thousands of genomes and beyond.
I also advocated for and helped initiate a new [Ensembl core library in Python](https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-py).

I continued to maintain and contribute to the eHive workflow manager, ensuring it remained the most efficient solution for Ensembl's Comparative Genomics workflows.

### Project Leader

_May 2014 to Sep 2019_

<u>Keywords</u>: Project planning and management. Scientific and public communication. Technical leadership. Recruitment. Mentorship.
Development management. Reporting. Data-production planning and operational management.
API development. Database design and optimisation. Workflow design and development. Data
production under tight deadlines. Processing of large datasets. User support (data, API, workflows).<br/>
<u>Team size</u>: 2-5 people.

I managed the Comparative Genomics team for Ensembl, including development of the eHive workflow manager.

We integrated [TreeFam activities into Ensembl](https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1112451.1) and prioritised scaling up analyses while [maintaining high data quality](https://f1000research.com/posters/6-1894), introducing [novel metrics](https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1115084.1) to monitor performance.

During this period we published landmark papers describing [comparative resources](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bav096) and [ncRNA phylogenetic analyses](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bav127).

Within eHive, I initiated support for additional programming languages, starting with Python,
which enabled teams to plan a gradual phase-out of Perl.
We authored an extensive user manual for eHive and provided technical support to other Ensembl teams.
I also added container support (via Docker Swarm) to allow eHive to run in cloud environments.

### Interim Manager

_May 2013 to May 2014_

<u>Keywords</u>: Development management. Reporting. Technical advisor. Data-production planning and operational management.
API development. Database design and optimisation. Workflow design and development. Data
production under tight deadlines. Processing of large datasets. User support (data, API, workflows).<br/>
<u>Team size</u>: 2 people.

I managed part of the Comparative Genomics team at Ensembl, including development of the [eHive workflow manager](https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1111870.1), while continuing developer duties. Our work focused on reconstructing phylogenetic trees and gene families, improving the software, and delivering Ensembl API workshops.

### Software Developer

_Jan 2011 to May 2013_

<u>Keywords</u>: API development. Database design and optimisation. Workflow design and development. Data
production under tight deadlines. Processing of large datasets. User support (data, API, workflows).

I focused on the pipeline that reconstructs protein phylogenetic trees, reshaping the API, and improving the software. I also delivered Ensembl API workshops.

## École normale supérieure, Paris, France

### PhD student

_Sep 2006 to Dec 2010_

<u>Title</u>: Reconstruction of ancestral vertebrate genomes

I developed methods to infer the genome structure of ancestral species (the last common ancestors of groups of extant species — here ~50 vertebrates) at multiple scales (chromosome count, chromosome content, gene order). We also created a database and genome browser, [Genomicus](http://www.dyogen.ens.fr/genomicus/), to share the data. Because Genomicus uses Ensembl data, it is updated every two months after each Ensembl release.

Key &#x1F4D6; publications include a [review paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.20707), a [methods paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01956-z), and the [project website](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq079).
The thesis (French) and presentation (English) are available [online](http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00552138_v1/).

# Projects

## 2019 Google Summer of Code Mentor

_May 2019 to Sep 2019_

<u>Title</u>: Using deep learning techniques to enhance orthology calls

This project was part of the 2019 Google Summer of Code programme. [Harshit Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshit-gupta-a454a3149/) developed a machine-learning algorithm to predict orthologies in the Ensembl Genomes Browser organisation under the supervision of myself and [Mateus Patricio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateus-patricio-03057aa8/).

We developed a TensorFlow-based algorithm that predicts orthologies directly from sequence data, without relying on phylogenetic methods. The approach achieved high accuracy (>90% in most settings), and we are planning its deployment in Ensembl.

## 2016 Google Summer of Code Mentor

_May 2016 to Sep 2016_

<u>Title</u>: Graphical editor for XML files

This project was part of the 2016 Google Summer of Code programme. [Anuj Khandelwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuj-khandelwal-2a7151103/) developed a graphical workflow editor for eHive using Blockly under the supervision of myself and [Leo Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-gordon-cambridge/).

eHive runs computation pipelines in distributed environments and its workflows were configured in a file format that required programming skills. This project aimed to remove that barrier by creating a Blockly-based graphical editor.

We targeted XML as the file format with a Relax NG specification. The editor's core converts a Relax NG specification to Blockly blocks and matching rules so Blockly diagrams conform to the schema. The interface can import existing XML to visualise workflows as Blockly blocks, edit them, and export back to XML.

The project is not specific to eHive; the editor can handle any specification written in Relax NG.
